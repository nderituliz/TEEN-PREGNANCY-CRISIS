                            <p>Teenage pregnancies are a global problem but occur most often in poorer and marginalised communities. Many girls face considerable pressure to marry early and become mothers while they are still young. 
            
                            Teenage pregnancy increases when girls are denied the right to make decisions about their sexual and reproductive health and well-being. 
                            
                            Girls must be able to make their own decisions about their bodies and futures and have access to appropriate healthcare services and education. For this to happen, girls need to been given information about their

                    <h3>SEXUAL ORIENTATION</h3>
                    <p>Your sexual orientation is who you are attracted to, emotionally and physically. You don’t choose your sexual orientation – it is part of who you are.
                        

                        Your sexual orientation could be:</p>
                        <img src="images/home-img/orientation.webp">
                        <ul>  
                        
                        <li>Heterosexual: this is someone who is attracted to people of the opposite gender. If this is you, you might also say you are straight.</li>
                        
                        <li>Homosexual: this is someone who is attracted to people of the same gender as themselves. If this is you, you might choose to use words like gay, queer or lesbian.</li>
                        
                        <li>Bisexual: this is someone who is attracted to males and females.</li>
                        
                        <li>Asexual: this is someone who does not feel significant sexual attraction to anyone.</li>
                        
                        <li>Pansexual: this is someone who is attracted to a range of genders ,for example, males, females, gender queer and gender fluid or trans people.</li>
                        
                        <li>Some people don’t like or don’t use labels to describe their sexual orientation. This could be because they haven’t found a label that feels right for them, because they don’t yet know or they don’t think labels matter.</li> 
                        </li>
                    <h3>SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH</h3>
                        <p>If you have a uterus and ovaries and any of your sexual partners have testicles, you might want to think about contraception to help prevent pregnancy - no matter what your identity is. Unless a doctor has told you it is not possible for you to get pregnant or get your partner pregnant you need to use contraception if you don’t want a pregnancy.
                        
                        Anyone who is sexually active should think about protection against STIs. For example, some people think that women who are having sex with women don’t have to worry about STIs or smear tests but this is not true. It’s the type of sexual contact you’re having, not your sexual orientation or gender identity that puts you at greater or lesser risk for STIs.
                        
                        Condoms (and lube) offer the best protection against STIs especially if you are having anal sex.
                        
                        Cervical screening is important for anyone who has a cervix. The nurse or doctor may suggest some ways to make a smear more comfortable – for instance they might suggest you insert the speculum yourself or that you leave any prosthetics in place.
                        
                        If you are under 26, you can now get the HPV vaccine for free – no matter what gender or sex you are. This can help you to protect yourself against genital warts and some cancers.

                    <h3>GENDER IDENTITY</h3>
                    <img src="images/home-img/identity.jpeg">
                    <p>Our gender identity is about our sense of being a man or a woman or someone else. It may not be the same as the sex we were assigned at birth.

                        For example, someone who was born with a penis and testicles would be assigned male on their birth certificate. 
                        However they may feel, identify and live as a woman.
                        <em>Intersex</em> refers to the people who are born along the continuum between male and female. Someone can be intersex due to chromosomes, hormones or reproductive organs.
                         It is a lot more common than people think.  
                        
                       <h4>GENDER IDENTITY TERMS:</h4>
                       <ul>
                        <li>Agender – not having a gender or gender expressions</li>
                        
                        <li>Bi-gender – someone who identifies as having two genders</li>
                        
                        <li>Cisgender – someone whose gender identity matches their sex assigned at birth, e.g. someone assigned male at birth who lives as a man</li>
                        
                        <li>Gender fluid – no fixed gender identity</li>
                        
                        <li>Genderqueer – an umbrella term for people who reject the gender binary of man/woman, genderqueer is also an identity term</li>
                        
                        <li>Non-binary – an umbrella term for people who reject the gender binary of man/woman, non-binary is also an identity term</li>
                        
                        <li>Trans-feminine – identifying on the feminine end of the gender spectrum, often assigned male at birth</li>
                        
                        <li>Trans-masculine – identifying on the masculine end of the gender spectrum, often assigned female at birth</li>

                    <h3>PERIODS</h3>
                   <p>Having your period is normal and healthy. A period is part of the cycle you’ll go through each month as your body prepares itself for a possible pregnancy. If you don’t become pregnant, the lining of your uterus comes out of your vagina, as a period.
                    
                    <h4>WHAT IS A PERIOD? </h4>
                    <img src="images/home-img/flow2.webp" style="height: 250; width: 350;">
                    Each month hormones can an egg (ova) in the ovaries to start maturing and be released from the ovary. This process is called <em>ovulation.</em>
                    
                    The egg moves along the fallopian tube towards the uterus. At the same time, the lining of the uterus becoomes thick and soft with blood and tissue. This happens just in case the egg is fertilised. It would then implant itself into the lining of the uterus and grow. 
                    
                    <em>Fertilisation</em> only happens if the egg joins with a sperm. More often than not, the egg isn't fertilised so it is just reabsorbed back into the body. 
                    
                    When the egg is not fertilised, the lining of the uterus is not needed so it comes away and is released through your vagina. 
                    
                    This is what is called menstruation or a period.
                    
                    <h4>SYMPTOMS THAT COME WITH PERIODS</h4>
                    Getting your period means the hormone levels in your body change. The two hormones are oestrogen and progesterone.
                    <img src="images/home-img/flowsymptoms.webp">
                    These changes can cause different symptoms before or during your period, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cramps – it is common to have some cramps at the beginning of a period.  They may be mild or severe enough to need medication</li>
                        <li>Headaches - or migraines in the few days leading up to or during your period</li>
                        <li>Sore breasts - swelling and soreness can happen before your period</li>
                        <li>Diarrhoea - prostaglandins (chemicals released during your period) help the muscles in your uterus and intestines to move, but can also give you diarrhoea (runny poo). Prostaglandins can also cause vomiting</li>
                        <li>Bloating – feeling full and tight in your tummy before and with your period</li>
                        <li>Pimples – you might get pimples on your face or body seven to ten days before your period</li>
                        <li>Cravings – you might really want to eat particular foods before your period</li>
                        <li>Tiredness – anaemia (very low number of red blood cells) from heavy bleeding can be a cause of tiredness.</li>
                    <h4>WHAT’S IN A PERIOD?</h4>
                    Blood, cells from the lining of the uterus, cervical mucus and vaginal discharge
                    You will normally lose between 4 and 12 teaspoons of blood each period.
                    The colour of the blood might change from red, to brown or black, towards the end of your period. This colour change is normal. The darker colour is a sign that the blood is slightly older, because it is not leaving your body as quickly.
                    
                    There might also be clots in your blood. Usually your body tries to stop period blood from clotting, but if you have a heavy period, there might not be enough time to do this, so clots form. If they are large (about the size of a $2 coin or larger), it is a good idea to see a doctor or nurse at Family Planning.
                    
                    <h4>AFTER YOURSELF</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Treating period pain</li>
                        <li>Gentle exercise might help with cramps</li>
                        <li>Try some relaxation techniques</li>
                        <li>Heat pads (wheat bag/hot water bottle)</li>
                        <li>Taking pain relief medication like ibuprofen, paracetamol or aspirin</li>
                        <li>Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol</li>
                        <li>Talk to a nurse or doctor about what types of contraception might help your period pain.</li>
                    <h4>What to use:</h4>
                        <li>Pads - These are cotton pads that stick to your underwear to soak up blood, and which you throw away after use. They come in many different shapes and types of absorbency (the amount of blood they can soak up).
                        <img src="images/home-img/pad.jpg"></li>
                        <li>Tampons - These are pieces of cotton with a string at one end. You put them into your vagina to soak up your blood, and pull them out using the string. You should change a tampon every 4-6 hours, or as needed. You can choose from a range of sizes, depending on how heavy your period is. 
                          <img src="images/home-img/tampon.jpg"  ></li>
                        <li>Menstrual cups - These are soft rubber cups that are put into the vagina to catch the blood flow. You empty the cup every 8-12 hours, rinse it under water, and put it back in.
                        <img src="images/home-img/cup.jpg"></li>
                        <li> Reusable pads - These are cloth pads that you can wash and reuse. They are usually made of absorbent material like cotton or bamboo. It is recommended that after using the pad, you rinse it, soak it overnight and then wash it.  
                        <img src="images/home-img/reuse.jpg"></li>
                        <li>Period underwear - These look and feel like your regular underwear, but are very absorbent. They can be used instead of pads or tampons when you have a light flow, or as a back-up when you have a heavy flow.  </p>

                    <p>People have sex for lots of different reasons, such as to show love and affection or to make babies. Pleasure is a big reason - sex should feel good and be enjoyable.<p>

                        <h4>HOW DO I CHOOSE WHEN I AM READY TO HAVE SEX?</h4>
                        <p>When you choose to have sex, it is important that both you and your partner are ready for it and you both agree to any sexual activity, every time you are sexual.  It is about enjoying it and feeling comfortable with what is happening. You can change your mind at any time. You don't have to do anything that you don't feel comfortable doing.
                        
                        Having sex will not necessarily:
                        <ul>
                            <li>make you more mature </li>
                            <li>give you better status with your friends</li>
                            <li>make your relationship stronger or closer</li>
                            <li>give you an orgasm or immense pleasure - or be terrible either</li>
                            <li>look like it did on TV or at the movies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>WHAT IS VAGINAL SEX?</h4>
                        Vaginal sex is when the penis is put into the vagina. It is also called sexual intercourse.
                        
                        You can get pregnant from vaginal sex, including the first time. This means it is really important to use contraception consistently and correctly.
                        
                        You can get a sexually transmissible infection (STI) from vaginal sex. Always use a condom if you're having vaginal sex and put on before the penis comes near the vagina. As soon as the penis is erect it will have drops of pre-ejaculate on it. This pre-ejaculate will contain sperm.
                        
                        <h4>WHAT IS ORAL SEX?</h4>
                        Oral sex is when you use your mouth to stimulate your partner's genitals. There are different words that people sometimes use when they're talking about oral sex:
                        
                        blow job or fellatio. This describes the sucking and licking of a penis
                        cunnilingus. This is the sucking and licking of a woman's vulva.
                        CAN YOU GET AN STI FROM ORAL SEX?
                        Yes. Using a condom or oral dam will protect against STIs.
                        
                        <h4>WHAT IS ANAL SEX?</h4>
                        Anal sex is when a penis or another object such as a finger or sex toy is inserted into the anus. Anal tissue is very sensitive and touch can be pleasurable for some people.
                        
                        Like vaginal and oral sex, you can get an STI from anal sex. You should always use a condom and lube. The anus doesn't have a natural lubricant and can damage easily. Never force anything into the anus.
                        
                        WHAT IS MASTURBATION?
                        Masturbation or wanking is when you stimulate the genitals with your hand or other objects such as a pillow or vibrator. It is a pleasurable way to learn about your body and what you like or don't like.
                        
                        Masturbation is a normal, healthy activity. It can be done either alone or with a partner. It should be done in a private place such as a bedroom. It can help reduce spontaneous erections in adolescent males and it won't affect your fertility.
                        
                        Rumours that masturbating will make you run out of sperm are just that - rumours.</p>
                        <h4>SEXUALYY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS</h4>
                        <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections or STIs, are very common. Millions of new infections occur every year in the United States.

                            STDs are passed from one person to another through sexual activity including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. They can also be passed from one person to another through intimate physical contact, such as heavy petting, though this is not very common.
                            
                            STDs don’t always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms, so it is possible to have an infection and not know it. That is why it is important to get tested if you are having sex. If you are diagnosed with an STD, know that all can be treated with medicine and some can be cured entirely.
                            
                            STDs are preventable. If you have sex, know how to protect yourself and your sexual partner from STDs.

                              <h4>Chlamydia</h4>
                              <img src="images/home-img/chlamydia.jpg">
                                This is one of the most common STIs. It is caused by a bacterium that exists in vaginal secretions and semen ("cum"). It can be spread by vaginal, oral, or anal sex without a condom or latex/polyurethane barrier. Pregnant women can pass it on to their babies during delivery. Symptoms may include vaginal discharge and burning during urination, but most women do not have any symptoms. Chlamydia can be successfully treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, it can spread to a woman's upper, internal reproductive organs (ovaries and fallopian tubes) and cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can lead to infertility, meaning that it may be difficult or impossible to become pregnant.
                                
                                The CDC recommends yearly chlamydia screening for all sexually active women under the age of 25, as well as for older women with risk factors, such as new or multiple sex partners. Unfortunately, recent reports show that less than half of sexually active women under 25 are screened for chlamydia, in part because of a lack of awareness among health care providers. If you are not offered a chlamydia test, you may want to request one from your health care provider.
                                
                                <h4>Genital Warts</h4>
                                Genital warts are caused by viruses. HPV (Human Papillomavirus) is the name of a large group of viruses. Certain types of HPV cause warts on the hands or feet. Other types cause infections in the genital area that can lead to genital warts, cervical cancer, or cancer of the vulva, vagina, anus, or penis. Genital HPV is spread easily through skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Condoms do not entirely prevent transmission. People living with HIV are more likely to be infected with HPV than HIV-negative people. People living with HIV and HPV are also more likely to develop genital warts, as well as cervical or anal cancer.
                                
                                It is important to find HPV early and get treatment to prevent health problems. Regular cervical screening tests are a good way to check for HPV. There are also three effective HPV vaccines. Since the introduction of the HPV vaccines several years ago, the number of 14- to 19-year old girls infected with HPV in the US has dropped by more than half. It is important for young people to get vaccinated before they have sex (before they have been exposed to HPV), since people who are already infected with HPV may not be protected by the vaccines. For more information, see our fact sheet on HPV.
                                
                                <h4>Gonorrhea</h4>
                                Often called "the clap," this STI is transmitted by a bacterium in vaginal secretions and semen. It can be spread through vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom or latex/polyurethane barrier. Symptoms may include a yellowish or greenish vaginal discharge and a burning feeling when urinating. Gonorrhea can also affect the anus and the throat. Many women have no symptoms. Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, it can cause PID and infertility. All sexually active women should be screened for gonorrhea.
                                
                                <h4>Herpes</h4>
                                This STI is caused by a virus that lives in the nerves. There are two common types of herpes. Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) usually causes cold sores around the mouth. Herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) usually causes sores in the genital area. However, it is possible to get HSV-2 in the mouth and HSV-1 in the genital area. Symptoms include itchy or painful blisters. The virus is spread through skin-to-skin contact with sores, but it may also spread even before sores can be seen on the infected person. In most people, the sores come and go, but the virus stays in the body for life. Sometimes there are no symptoms because the virus is "hiding" in the nerves. Some women living with HIV never had blisters or sores before they became infected with HIV, and are then surprised when they develop an "outbreak" of sores because their immune systems are weakened by HIV.
                                
                                Genital HSV-2 infection is more common in women than men. In addition, women living with HIV may have more frequent herpes outbreaks that may be more difficult to treat. There is no cure for herpes, but the antiviral drugs Zovirax (acyclovir), Valtrex (valacyclovir), and Famvir (famciclovir) can reduce the number of outbreaks if taken daily, and can shorten outbreaks and make them less severe if taken as soon as symptoms begin. Valtrex has also been shown to lower your risk of passing the infection to someone else. Pregnant women can pass herpes to their babies, so it is important to let your health care provider know if you have genital herpes and you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
                                
                                <h4>HIV</h4>
                                <img src="images/home-img/hiv79.jpg">
                                <p>HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. It is present in blood, vaginal secretions, semen, and breast milk. HIV can be spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex without a condom or latex/polyurethane barrier. As many as one in five people living with HIV in the US do not know they have the virus. Many people living with HIV look and feel healthy and do not think they are at risk for becoming sick or passing HIV to others.
                                
                                Getting tested for HIV is part of routine, regular health care in many countries. The Public Health Agency of Canada, for example, recommends that HIV testing be discussed as part of routine medical care. The CDC now recommends testing all people ages 13 to 64, unless they have already been tested. It also recommends that you get tested for HIV before beginning a new sexual relationship, regardless of your age.
                                
                                The World Health Organization (WHO) makes different suggestions based on where you live. Where HIV is widespread, it recommends that HIV testing be offered to anyone who goes to a healthcare facility. Where HIV is less common, it suggests that HIV tests be offered to people who may be at higher risk of having been exposed to HIV.
                                
                                It is important that you also get tested if:
                                
                                You have ever had vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom
                                You have ever shared needles or syringes to inject drugs or other substances
                                You are uncertain of your partner's status or your partner is living with HIV
                                You are pregnant or are considering becoming pregnant
                                You have ever been diagnosed with an STI or STD
                                You have hepatitis C
                                You begin treatment for tuberculosis (TB)
                                If left untreated, HIV can cause serious illness and death. If you test HIV+ there are effective medications to help you stay well. But you cannot get the health care and treatment you need if you do not know your HIV status. For more information on HIV, go to the section on The Well Project website called HIV: The Basics.
                                
                                <h4>Syphilis</h4>
                                <img src="images/home-img/syph79.jpg">
                                This STI is caused by a bacterium. It can be spread by vaginal, anal, or oral sex without a condom or latex/polyurethane barrier. The disease has several phases. People with primary syphilis (early disease) may have pain-free open sores, called chancres, in the genital or anal area or around the mouth. The sores usually heal on their own within three to six weeks. People with secondary syphilis (a later stage of the disease) often have a rash and/or hair loss. If left untreated, syphilis can proceed to the latent stage during which it may have no visible symptoms but can cause damage to the heart, brain, and other organs. Syphilis can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Without treatment, it can hurt your body's organs, leading to severe illness and even death. Pregnant women can pass syphilis to their babies during pregnancy and childbirth, so it is important that pregnant women get tested for syphilis.
                
                                <h4>Chancroid</h4>
                                <p>This STI is caused by a bacterium. Symptoms may include genital sores, vaginal discharge, a burning feeling when urinating, and swollen lymph nodes in the groin. It can be spread by vaginal or anal sex or skin-to-skin contact with sores. Chancroid can be treated with antibiotics.
                                
                                <h4>Hepatitis</h4>
                                <img src="images/home-img/hepatitis.jpg">
                                <p>Hepatitis is an inflammation (irritation) of the liver. Some types of hepatitis are caused by viruses that exist in blood, vaginal secretions, semen, and breast milk. These include hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV), all of which can be sexually transmitted. There is a vaccine to prevent HAV and HBV, but not HCV. HAV goes away on its own, but HBV and HCV can become chronic (long-term) and very serious. Because HBV and HCV often have no symptoms, most people do not know that they have the infection. It is important for people living with HIV to be tested for HBV and HCV and treated, if necessary. For more information, see our article on Treatment of Hepatitis C in People Living with HIV.
                                
                                <h4>Pubic Lice ("Crabs")</h4>
                                Pubic lice live in the pubic hair (the hair around the genitals) and can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. They can also be spread through infected clothes and bedding. Symptoms may include intense itching and seeing lice or eggs in the hair. Pubic lice can be treated with over-the-counter medications. However, pregnant women must use products specially designed for them. Contaminated clothes, sheets, pillowcases, blankets, and towels should be washed in hot water and laundry soap to kill lice and eggs and to prevent being infected again.
                                
                                <h4>Trichomoniasis</h4>
                                <img src="images/home-img/trich79.jpg">
                                <p>This STI is caused by a single-celled germ called a protozoa. It can be spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex without a condom or latex/polyurethane barrier. Trichomoniasis is a common cause of vaginal infections. Symptoms may include a foamy, foul-smelling vaginal discharge and itching. Sometimes there are no symptoms at all. Trichomoniasis can be successfully treated with antibiotics. When a woman is infected with trichomoniasis, she and her sexual partner must both be treated, or the untreated partner can re-infect her.
                                
                                Protecting Yourself and Others
                                You can greatly reduce your risk of getting sexually transmitted infections by practicing safer sex. Some STIs such as genital warts, herpes, and syphilis can be spread through contact with infected skin. Here are some tips for protecting yourself:
                                
                                Use a latex condom for vaginal and anal sex or a plastic condom if you are sensitive to latex
                                The internal (female) condom can also prevent many sexually transmitted infections
                                Use condoms without lubricant for oral sex on a man
                                Use latex or plastic barriers, such as a dental dams or plastic wrap, for oral sex on a woman or for oral-anal sex; use latex or plastic gloves if you have cuts or sores on your hands
                                Use water-based lubricants (KY, Astroglide) with latex condoms or barriers
                                DO NOT use oil-based products (Vaseline, body lotions) because they destroy latex
                                Do not use lubricants or condoms that contain nonoxynol-9 (N-9), which can damage the lining of the vagina or anus and increase the chances of getting HIV
                                Wash shared sex toys (dildos, vibrators) or put on a fresh condom between users
                                Know that some methods of birth control, such as birth control pills, shots, implants, or diaphragms, will not protect you from sexually transmitted infections. If you use one of these methods, also use a latex condom.
                                Talk with your sex partner(s) about sexually transmitted infections and using condoms
                                Talk honestly with your health care provider and your sex partner(s) about any sexually transmitted infections you or your partner has or has had
                                Have regular pelvic exams and cervical cancer screenings, but remember that cervical cancer screening tests do not screen for sexually transmitted infections other than HPV
                                Talk to your health care provider about having routine sexually transmitted infection screening as part of your annual physical or gynecological exam
                                Do not share needles or syringes for injecting drugs or other substances; if you do share drug equipment, be sure to clean your works
                                The Bottom Line
                                There are many sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Some can be cured with treatment. Some, like HIV and herpes, cannot be cured, but can be managed. Many can cause serious health and fertility problems, or even death, if left untreated. Practicing safer sex can protect you from many, but not all, STIs.</p>

                        The truth is:
                        
                        you can get pregnant the first time you have sex
                        you can get pregnant if you have sex while you have your period
                        you can get pregnant even if you have sex standing up
                        washing or squirting things into the vagina (sometimes called douching) will not stop you getting pregnant
                        you can get pregnant if you have sex in the water
                        you can get pregnant if your partner pulls out before they cum (ejaculate).
                        WHAT DO I DO IF I THINK I AM PREGNANT?
                        It is important to have a test to confirm the pregnancy and discuss your options with someone as soon as possible.
                        
                        If you've had unprotected sex in the last three to five days you still have time to use emergency contraception.
                        Anyone who finds out they are hapū (pregnant) is faced with a decision that requires careful thought. Once the pregnancy is confirmed, there are some options to consider – only you can decide the best one for you.

                        WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST?
                        The first step is to take a test to confirm the pregnancy.
                        
                        To get the most accurate result, we recommend you wait at least a week after you’ve missed your period to take the test. It is best to do the test first thing in the morning, when your urine is most concentrated.
                        
                        The earlier you confirm the pregnancy, the more time you have to make a decision and the better you can take care of yourself.
                        
                        You can get a reliable pregnancy test, advice and referral for pregnancy care at any of our clinics. You can also get a pregnancy test from your doctor, other sexual health clinics, pharmacies or supermarkets.
                        
                       
                        
                        <h4 >ABORTION</h4>
                        This is the termination of a pregnancy.
                        If you are considering an abortion, it is important that you consult an adult. In most cases abortions may lead to death and guilt.
                        
                        You should make an appointment at Family Planning or with your doctor to talk about your options as early as possible in your pregnancy
                        
                        It is your decision to request an abortion and it is your decision not to have one. No one has the right to make you consent to an abortion or to stop you having one
                        You will be given the opportunity of talking with a counsellor before making your decision
                        You can change your mind at any time
                        You can have an Early Medical Abortion (EMA) if you are less than nine weeks pregnant. Surgical abortions are usually done up to 12 weeks and six days into the pregnancy, but can be done later. The doctor/nurse will explain the different abortion methods

                        <h3>CONTRACEPTIVES:</h3>
                        <p>Contraception is a way to prevent pregnancy.Many elements need to be considered by women, men, or couples at any given point in their lifetimes when choosing the most appropriate contraceptive method. These elements include safety, effectiveness, availability (including accessibility and affordability), and acceptability. Voluntary informed choice of contraceptive methods is an essential guiding principle, and contraceptive counseling, when applicable, might be an important contributor to the successful use of contraceptive methods.

                            In choosing a method of contraception, dual protection from the simultaneous risk for HIV and other STDs also should be considered. Although hormonal contraceptives and IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy, they do not protect against STDs, including HIV. Consistent and correct use of the male latex condom reduces the risk for HIV infection and other STDs, including chlamydial infection, gonococcal infection, and trichomoniasis.

                            <p>IUD
                            <em>Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUD)</em>—The LNG IUD is a small T-shaped device like the Copper T IUD. It is placed inside the uterus by a doctor. It releases a small amount of progestin each day to keep you from getting pregnant. The LNG IUD stays in your uterus for up to 3 to 6 years, depending on the device. Typical use failure rate: 0.1-0.4%.1
                            
                            <em>Copper T intrauterine device (IUD)</em>—This IUD is a small device that is shaped in the form of a “T.” Your doctor places it inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It can stay in your uterus for up to 10 years. Typical use failure rate: 0.8%.1
                            
                            <h4>Hormonal Methods</h4>
                            <h4>birth control implant</h4>
                            <em>Implant</em>—The implant is a single, thin rod that is inserted under the skin of a women’s upper arm. The rod contains a progestin that is released into the body over 3 years. Typical use failure rate: 0.1%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/BC-Implant-01.png">
                            <p><em>shot</em>
                            Injection or “shot”—Women get shots of the hormone progestin in the buttocks or arm every three months from their doctor. Typical use failure rate: 4%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/Shot-01.png">
                            <p><em>oral contraception</em>
                            Combined oral contraceptives—Also called “the pill,” combined oral contraceptives contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. A pill is taken at the same time each day. If you are older than 35 years and smoke, have a history of blood clots or breast cancer, your doctor may advise you not to take the pill. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/Oral-01.png">
                            <p>Progestin only pill—Unlike the combined pill, the progestin-only pill (sometimes called the mini-pill) only has one hormone, progestin, instead of both estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. It is taken at the same time each day. It may be a good option for women who can’t take estrogen. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1
                            
                            <em>birth control patch</em>
                            Patch—This skin patch is worn on the lower abdomen, buttocks, or upper body (but not on the breasts). This method is prescribed by a doctor. It releases hormones progestin and estrogen into the bloodstream. You put on a new patch once a week for three weeks. During the fourth week, you do not wear a patch, so you can have a menstrual period. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/BC-Patch-01.png">
                            <p><em>Ring</em>
                            Hormonal vaginal contraceptive ring—The ring releases the hormones progestin and estrogen. You place the ring inside your vagina. You wear the ring for three weeks, take it out for the week you have your period, and then put in a new ring. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/BC-Ring-01.png">
                            <h4>Barrier Methods</h4>
                            <em>Diaphragm</em>
                            Diaphragm or cervical cap—Each of these barrier methods are placed inside the vagina to cover the cervix to block sperm. The diaphragm is shaped like a shallow cup. The cervical cap is a thimble-shaped cup. Before sexual intercourse, you insert them with spermicide to block or kill sperm. Visit your doctor for a proper fitting because diaphragms and cervical caps come in different sizes. Typical use failure rate for the diaphragm: 17%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/Diaphragm-01.png">
                            <p><em>Sponge</em>—The contraceptive sponge contains spermicide and is placed in the vagina where it fits over the cervix. The sponge works for up to 24 hours, and must be left in the vagina for at least 6 hours after the last act of intercourse, at which time it is removed and discarded. Typical use failure rate: 14% for women who have never had a baby and 27% for women who have had a baby.1
                            
                            <em>male condom</em>
                            Male condom—Worn by the man, a male condom keeps sperm from getting into a woman’s body. Latex condoms, the most common type, help prevent pregnancy, and HIV and other STDs, as do the newer synthetic condoms. “Natural” or “lambskin” condoms also help prevent pregnancy, but may not provide protection against STDs, including HIV. Typical use failure rate: 13%.1 Condoms can only be used once. You can buy condoms, KY jelly, or water-based lubricants at a drug store. Do not use oil-based lubricants such as massage oils, baby oil, lotions, or petroleum jelly with latex condoms. They will weaken the condom, causing it to tear or break.

                            Spermicides—These products work by killing sperm and come in several forms—foam, gel, cream, film, suppository, or tablet. They are placed in the vagina no more than one hour before intercourse. You leave them in place at least six to eight hours after intercourse. You can use a spermicide in addition to a male condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. They can be purchased at drug stores. Typical use failure rate: 21%.1

                            fertility awareness-based methods
                            <em>Fertility awareness-based methods</em>—Understanding your monthly fertility patternexternal iconexternal icon can help you plan to get pregnant or avoid getting pregnant. Your fertility pattern is the number of days in the month when you are fertile (able to get pregnant), days when you are infertile, and days when fertility is unlikely, but possible. If you have a regular menstrual cycle, you have about nine or more fertile days each month. If you do not want to get pregnant, you do not have sex on the days you are fertile, or you use a barrier method of birth control on those days. Failure rates vary across these methods.1-2 Range of typical use failure rates: 2-23%.1
                            <img src="images/home-img/Fertility_Awareness-01.png">
                            <h4>Lactational Amenorrhea Method</h4>
                            lactational amenorrhea method
                            For women who have recently had a baby and are breastfeeding, the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) can be used as birth control when three conditions are met: 1) amenorrhea (not having any menstrual periods after delivering a baby), 2) fully or nearly fully breastfeeding, and 3) less than 6 months after delivering a baby. LAM is a temporary method of birth control, and another birth control method must be used when any of the three conditions are not met.
                            <img src="images/home-img/LAM-01.png">
                            <h4>Emergency Contraception</h4>
                            <p>Emergency contraception is NOT a regular method of birth control. Emergency contraception can be used after no birth control was used during sex, or if the birth control method failed, such as if a condom broke.

                            <p>emergency contraception
                            <em>Copper IUD</em>—Women can have the copper T IUD inserted within five days of unprotected sex.
                            
                            <em>Emergency contraceptive pills</em>—Women can take emergency contraceptive pills up to 5 days after unprotected sex, but the sooner the pills are taken, the better they will work. There are three different types of emergency contraceptive pills available in the United States. Some emergency contraceptive pills are available over the counter.
                            
                            <h4>Permanent Methods of Birth Control</h4>

                            <img src="images/home-img/Permanent-01.png">
                            <p><em>Female Sterilization—Tubal ligation or “tying tubes”</em>— A woman can have her fallopian tubes tied (or closed) so that sperm and eggs cannot meet for fertilization. The procedure can be done in a hospital or in an outpatient surgical center. You can go home the same day of the surgery and resume your normal activities within a few days. This method is effective immediately. Typical use failure rate: 0.5%.1
                            
                            <em>Male Sterilization–Vasectomy</em>—This operation is done to keep a man’s sperm from going to his penis, so his ejaculate never has any sperm in it that can fertilize an egg. The procedure is typically done at an outpatient surgical center. The man can go home the same day. Recovery time is less than one week. After the operation, a man visits his doctor for tests to count his sperm and to make sure the sperm count has dropped to zero; this takes about 12 weeks. Another form of birth control should be used until the man’s sperm count has dropped to zero. Typical use failure rate: 0.15%.1
                            Finding postpartum contraception that is right for you is an important part of your postnatal care.

                            <strong>Some contraception can be used straight after delivery.</strong> We recommend progestogen-only methods, which research shows has no effect on breast milk volume, or on infant-growth.
                            
                            Contraceptive implant – the implant (Jadelle) lasts for five years and can be removed at any time. It is very effective, and can be inserted immediately after delivery
                            Depo Provera injection – the injection is given every 12 weeks and is very effective. It can be started immediately.
                            Condoms – condoms are a safe and affordable option and can be used at any time.
                            Emergency contraceptive pill – the ECP can be used any time after delivery and can be taken up to three days after sex. The ECP is less effective for those who weigh more than 70kg - an emergency IUD is best in this instance.
                            Other methods of contraception
                            Intra uterine device (IUD) – a copper or hormonal IUD can be inserted immediately after delivery, but it is more common to have it inserted six weeks later. It lasts for five plus years (depending on type) and can be removed at any time. A copper IUD can be inserted as emergency contraception in certain circumstances.
                            Combined oral contraceptive pill – when you can start taking the pill depends on a few factors, but your nurse will help work out what is best for you.
                            If you’re not breastfeeding – you can start taking the pill 21 days after delivery. If you are heavier, you will need to wait until 6 weeks, so talk to your nurse or midwife if this applies to you.
                            If you’re partially breastfeeding – you can start taking the pill after six weeks.
                            If you’re fully breastfeeding – you can start taking the pill after six months.
                            Breastfeeding as contraception
                            Breastfeeding can also be a form of contraception for the first six months after giving birth. Ask your nurse or midwife about how this works and what you need to be aware of during this time.</p>
