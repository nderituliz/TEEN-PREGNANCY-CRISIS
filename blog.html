            <h1><strong>Nancy Achieng's story - The violent truth about teenage pregnancy
            </strong></h1>
            <h2><strong> JUNE 10, 2020 </strong></h2> 
            <h3><em> Nancy Achieng, 15, receives help raising her daughter, Passy, from her grandparents <br >Mary and George. </em></h3>
        <P>
            Nancy Achieng’s grandparents had pinned their hopes on her after her parents died. At 12,she <br>
            was sharp and a good student. She would excel in high school and then study at a university,they <br>
            thought. Investing in Nancy meant investing in the family’s future.Then, at 13, Nancy had a baby girl.<br> 
            Passy, now 2, was born right before Nancy’s exams for entering high school were to start.“She hid the <br>
            fact that she was pregnant so well that we had no idea,” said Nancy’s grandfather, George Okuta Goga. <br>
             “One day, I came home, and Nancy had a baby,” he says, laughing now, but it was a shock at the time.<br>
           His wife recalled with sadness how they had reacted to the news. “We shouted at her, asking her how <br>
           could she do this,and we gave her a really hard time,” says Mary Odero, Nancy’s grandmother. “In the end,<br>
            we were afraid that Nancy would run away, or that she would hurt herself and the baby, or run off and get <br>
            married, so we changed. We realized we had to support her,” Mary says.
