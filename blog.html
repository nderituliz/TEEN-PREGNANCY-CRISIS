            <h1><strong>Nancy Achieng's story - The violent truth about teenage pregnancy
            </strong></h1>
            <h2><strong> JUNE 10, 2020 </strong></h2> 
            <h3><em> Nancy Achieng, 15, receives help raising her daughter, Passy, from her grandparents <br >Mary and George. </em></h3>
        <P>
            Nancy Achieng’s grandparents had pinned their hopes on her after her parents died. At 12,she <br>
            was sharp and a good student. She would excel in high school and then study at a university,they <br>
            thought. Investing in Nancy meant investing in the family’s future.Then, at 13, Nancy had a baby girl.<br> 
            Passy, now 2, was born right before Nancy’s exams for entering high school were to start.“She hid the <br>
            fact that she was pregnant so well that we had no idea,” said Nancy’s grandfather, George Okuta Goga. <br>
             “One day, I came home, and Nancy had a baby,” he says, laughing now, but it was a shock at the time.<br>
           His wife recalled with sadness how they had reacted to the news. “We shouted at her, asking her how <br>
           could she do this,and we gave her a really hard time,” says Mary Odero, Nancy’s grandmother. “In the end,<br>
            we were afraid that Nancy would run away, or that she would hurt herself and the baby, or run off and get <br>
            married, so we changed. We realized we had to support her,” Mary says.

                    People will say all kinds of things about us – about teenage mothers. They’ll say we’re lazy, or not <br>
                    interested in school, or foolish. But we’re not. We’re hardworking, and industrious, and sensible, and <br>
                    just looking for a way to support ourselves. What happened to me was all about financial problems. I <br>
                    needed money.My father died in 2011, so my mum, she has been struggling for a while. It worried me when <br>
                    I asked for money and she said she doesn’t have any. She was suffering to get the money.So I thought,<br> 
                    maybe I can also find a way to get the money I need. I met a man through selling snacks on the side of <br>
                    the road. But it wasn’t right.I didn’t know I was pregnant. My mum took me to the hospital and we took the <br>
                    pregnancy test, and everything was positive.Now he doesn’t come home. When we call him, he doesn’t pick up <br>
                    the calls. And so we’ve forgotten about him. I’m not a shy type; I don’t care what people say. I started back <br>
                    at school barely three months after giving birth. I even sometimes bring my friends to the house when I’m coming<br> 
                    to breastfeed the baby during break. But it has really changed my plans. By now, I would have been at Senior High<br> 
                    School (SHS) otherwise. I’m very happy to be back at school; I think I’m the only one in this village who has given<br> 
                    birth and gone back to school. I’m thinking of becoming a doctor. But what I want now after SHS is to work even harder,<br> 
                    so my son can go to a world class school, and he can learn, and be even better than me in the future.He just turned two <br>
                    in July. His name is Isaac. Sometimes, he picks up a hammer, and hits every nail that he sees, or he takes a pen, and uses <br>
                    it as a microphone, the way pastors do, so I’m thinking he will become a great furniture maker or a man of God one day.
